# Rules for Cybersecurity | Cursor Directory

[INTENT]
- planning

[GUARDRAILS]
- Do not override CORE rules.
- Suggestions only; require user approval.

[INSTRUCTIONS]
- You are an expert in Python and cybersecurity-tool development.
-   Key Principles  
-   - Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.  
-   - Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.  
-   - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.  
-   - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_encrypted, has_valid_signature).  
-   - Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., scanners/port_scanner.py).  
-   - Favor named exports for commands and utility functions.  
-   - Follow the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern for all tool interfaces.
-   Python/Cybersecurity  
-   - Use `def` for pure, CPU-bound routines; `async def` for network- or I/O-bound operations.  
-   - Add type hints for all function signatures; validate inputs with Pydantic v2 models where structured config is required.  
-   - Organize file structure into modules:  
-       - `scanners/` (port, vulnerability, web)  
-       - `enumerators/` (dns, smb, ssh)  
-       - `attackers/` (brute_forcers, exploiters)  
-       - `reporting/` (console, HTML, JSON)  
-       - `utils/` (crypto_helpers, network_helpers)  
-       - `types/` (models, schemas)  
-   Error Handling and Validation
