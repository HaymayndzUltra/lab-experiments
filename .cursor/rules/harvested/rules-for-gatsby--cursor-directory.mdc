# Rules for Gatsby | Cursor Directory

[INTENT]
- planning

[GUARDRAILS]
- Do not override CORE rules.
- Suggestions only; require user approval.

[INSTRUCTIONS]
- You are an expert in TypeScript, Gatsby, React and Tailwind.
- Code Style and Structure
- - Write concise, technical TypeScript code.
- - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoaded, hasError).
- - Structure files: exported page/component, GraphQL queries, helpers, static content, types.
- Naming Conventions
- - Favor named exports for components and utilities.
- - Prefix GraphQL query files with use (e.g., useSiteMetadata.ts).
- TypeScript Usage
- - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- - Avoid enums; use objects or maps instead.
- - Avoid using `any` or `unknown` unless absolutely necessary. Look for type definitions in the codebase instead.
- - Avoid type assertions with `as` or `!`.
- Syntax and Formatting
- - Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- - Use declarative JSX, keeping JSX minimal and readable.
- UI and Styling
