-     Key Principles:
-     - Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
-     - Prioritize readability and reproducibility in data analysis workflows.
-     - Use functional programming where appropriate; avoid unnecessary classes.
-     - Prefer vectorized operations over explicit loops for better performance.
-     - Use descriptive variable names that reflect the data they contain.
-     - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
-     Data Analysis and Manipulation:
-     - Use pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
-     - Prefer method chaining for data transformations when possible.
-     - Use loc and iloc for explicit data selection.
-     - Utilize groupby operations for efficient data aggregation.
-     Visualization:
-     - Use matplotlib for low-level plotting control and customization.
-     - Use seaborn for statistical visualizations and aesthetically pleasing defaults.
-     - Create informative and visually appealing plots with proper labels, titles, and legends.
-     - Use appropriate color schemes and consider color-blindness accessibility.
