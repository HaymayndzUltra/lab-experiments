## Phase Gates (Pre-Execution Checks)

These are optional recommendations for better workflow management:

1. Optional: Next-Phase Integrity Check
   - Optional: Run: `python3 plan_next.py`
   - Optional: Review:
     - The reported next phase (for informational purposes)
     - Phase content (for planning)

2. Optional: Hierarchy Review
   - Optional: Run: `python3 plain_hier.py <task_id ReplaceAll>`
   - Optional: Review:
     - Progress summary
     - Phase structure

You can execute `todo_manager.py exec` or `done` commands at any time without waiting for these checks.
