# LAB NOTES - Cursor Rules Framework

## Development Decisions

### Architecture
- **Simple Rule Engine**: Chose a straightforward pattern-matching approach for initial implementation
- **Dataclass-based Rules**: Used Python dataclasses for clean, type-safe rule definitions
- **File-based Configuration**: Rules can be loaded from JSON files for flexibility
- **Severity Levels**: Implemented error/warning/info levels for different rule types

### Technology Choices
- **Python 3.9+**: Modern Python with good type hints and dataclass support
- **Standard Library**: Minimal external dependencies for easier deployment
- **JSON Configuration**: Human-readable rule definitions
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment for consistency

## Current Implementation

### What's Working
- Basic rule definition and validation
- File scanning with pattern matching
- Configurable severity levels
- JSON-based rule loading
- Basic test coverage

### Limitations
- Simple string pattern matching (no regex support yet)
- No line number reporting in validation results
- Limited error handling and recovery
- No rule chaining or dependencies

## Risks & Considerations

### Technical Risks
- **Pattern Matching**: Current string-based matching may miss complex patterns
- **Performance**: Large files could be slow to process
- **Memory Usage**: Loading entire files into memory for validation
- **Error Handling**: Limited recovery from malformed rule files

### Security Risks
- **File Access**: Framework reads arbitrary files (potential path traversal)
- **Rule Injection**: JSON rule files could contain malicious patterns
- **Logging**: Sensitive file paths might be logged

### Maintenance Risks
- **Dependency Management**: No version pinning in requirements
- **Testing**: Limited test coverage for edge cases
- **Documentation**: Basic examples only

## Next Steps

### Short Term (Next 1-2 weeks)
1. **Enhanced Pattern Matching**
   - Add regex support for complex patterns
   - Support for multiline rule matching
   - Pattern validation and testing

2. **Improved Validation**
   - Line number reporting in results
   - Column position for precise issue location
   - Context lines around violations

3. **Better Error Handling**
   - Graceful fallback for malformed rules
   - Detailed error messages for debugging
   - Validation of rule configurations

### Medium Term (Next 1-2 months)
1. **Rule Engine Enhancements**
   - Rule chaining and dependencies
   - Conditional rule execution
   - Performance optimization for large files

2. **Integration Features**
   - IDE plugin support
   - CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Custom rule repositories

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Rule templates and presets
   - Automated rule generation
   - Rule effectiveness metrics

### Long Term (Next 3-6 months)
1. **Enterprise Features**
   - Multi-project rule management
   - Team collaboration tools
   - Rule compliance reporting

2. **Performance & Scale**
   - Parallel file processing
   - Incremental validation
   - Caching and optimization

## Testing Strategy

### Current Coverage
- Basic functionality tests
- Rule creation and loading
- File validation workflow

### Needed Tests
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Performance benchmarks
- Integration tests with real projects
- Security vulnerability tests

## Deployment Considerations

### Docker
- Lightweight base image (python:3.9-slim)
- Multi-stage builds for production
- Health checks and monitoring

### Production
- Logging configuration
- Error reporting and monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Security hardening

## Open Questions

1. **Rule Format**: Should we support YAML or other formats beyond JSON?
2. **Performance**: How should we handle very large codebases?
3. **Integration**: What IDEs and editors should we prioritize?
4. **Community**: How can we encourage rule sharing and collaboration?
